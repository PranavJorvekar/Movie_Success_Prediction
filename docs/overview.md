# Movie Success Prediction Project

## Overview

This project is a full-stack web application designed to predict the success or rating of movies using machine learning models. Users can input various details about a movie, and the system will provide a predicted rating or success metric based on trained models.

### Key Features
- **User-friendly Web Interface:** Built with Next.js and React for seamless user experience.
- **Machine Learning Backend:** Python-based backend leverages pre-trained models for fast and accurate predictions.
- **Data Analysis:** Includes scripts and visualizations for exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and feature relationships.
- **API Integration:** The frontend communicates with the backend via API endpoints for real-time predictions.

### Typical Workflow
1. User enters movie details in the web form.
2. The frontend sends the data to the backend API.
3. The backend processes the input and returns a prediction.
4. The frontend displays the predicted rating or success metric to the user.
