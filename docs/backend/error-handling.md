# Backend Error Handling

## Types of Errors
- Data validation errors (missing/invalid input)
- Model loading errors (missing/corrupt model files)
- Prediction errors (unexpected input, model failure)
- API/server errors (exceptions during request handling)

## How Errors are Handled
- Try/except blocks in API and prediction functions
- Returns structured error responses (JSON with error message and success: false)
- Logs errors to the console for debugging

## Example (from python/predict_api.py)
```python
try:
    # ... prediction logic ...
except Exception as e:
    return {
        'error': str(e),
        'success': False
    }
```

## User Feedback
- Frontend receives error messages and displays them to the user
- Encourages retry or correction of input
