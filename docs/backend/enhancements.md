# Possible Backend Enhancements

## Advanced Models
- Try deep learning models (e.g., neural networks, transformers)
- Use ensemble methods for improved accuracy

## Better Error Handling
- More detailed error messages
- Logging errors to files or monitoring systems
- Automated alerts for failures

## Monitoring & Analytics
- Track API usage and model performance over time
- Add dashboards for monitoring

## Scalability
- Containerize backend with Docker
- Deploy with scalable cloud infrastructure
